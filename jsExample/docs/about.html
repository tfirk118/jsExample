						<!--Alaria Johnson Biography-->
						<p>Alaria Johnson has been doodling on whatever piece of paper is near her for as long as she can remember.  Despite this, however, she never really considered herself an artist until as of late.  With the discovery of computerized image editing programs in the new millennium, her creative side took off.  Nowadays it&#39;s hard to pull her away from her tablet as she is almost always working on some new imaginative piece of work.  Even still, she has taken a keen liking to restoring old photographs and paintings with the use of this technology.  It has been said that if the art is savable, she can save it.</p>

						<!--Brent Sanders Biography-->
						<p>Brent Sanders has never been able to draw, paint, or even color with crayons right.  But, he was practically born with a camera in his hand.  Finding new angles and lightings to capture the moment has always been a passion of his.  Never perusing a formal photography education, Sanders has still managed to be featured in several photography showings in both New York and Boston.  Today, Brent lives in the moment, seeking new things to picture and to show the world.  Truly, he loves the hunt of the perfect picture.</p></div>
